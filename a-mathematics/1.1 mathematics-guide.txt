In this I learnt basic math programming 

1) Count Digits - Iterative / Recursive / Logarithmic
2) Factorial - Iterative/ Recursive
3) Trelling zeros - Using General solution
4) Palindrome - Reverse and equate
5) GCD - Euclidean Algo / Optimized Euclidean Algo
6) LCM - Using GCD
7) Check Prime - Optimizing it to O(sqrt(n)) {x*x <= n} / Optimizing it more by checking remainder with prime numbers
8) Prime Fcators - Same as check prime
9) All Divisors of the numbers - Same as check prime
10) Compute Power - Recursive / Iterative
11) Sieve of Eratosthenes - Find all prime numbers till n
